                        <p class="content" id="center">Teamwork in CS:GO is extremely important. What is an example of good teamwork? Firstly, teammates should relay information to one another, either through voice-chat
                            or the text chat. Having information on how much HP an enemy has and where they were last seen is very important as it allows your teammates to be prepared. Secondly, smoking and flashing together
                            is important. Each player is limited to buying 1 smoke and 2 flashes a round at most. This limits one person's ability to smoke all areas. However, if a teammate bought their own smoke, you can both 
                            smoke different areas. Furthermore, more flashes allow you to keep enemies blinded for longer. Lastly, teammates should not bait one another. Something you see often is players waiting for one another 
                            to push out to check where enemies are. This is usually sacrificing that one teammate for some information. Baiting is often looked down upon, but people still do it as they want to live. Even in situations
                            where you have to bait one another, you should try to at least trade your teammate (Kill the enemy while he is killing your teammate). These are some ways to improve teamwork in a team, allowing 
                            everyone to have fun.

                            <p>Toxicity is something you see often in multiplayer games. Some players will always be angry about something and try to ruin others' game. Players affected by this may also get
                                angry and retaliate. Sometimes, it may even be your friends who get toxic. If this ever happens with people you don't know, the best way to go about it would be to ignore them.
                                You can mute your teammates in the game. You could even report them for griefing and you will not see or here anything they say. If they try to disturb you in the game itself, you
                                could just let them kill you a few times or vote to kick them. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Dealing with toxic teammates you do not know may be easy, but what about friends? When your friends start to get toxic 
                                against you, try not to retaliate and let them calm down first. They may have just had a bad day and need to vent it all out of their system. However, if this happens very often, you might
                                want to rethink who you really want to be friends with. 
                            </p>
                            <p>This probably goes without saying but you yourself should never be toxic to anyone, anywhere, no matter the reason. Whenever you feel angry, calm down and remember it is just a game. 
                                Its whole purpose is to make you happy and have fun, not to be angry. Toxicity is not good for anybody and it usually just spreads, so try and not let it spread in the first place.
